## Advanced Enumerable Exercises

- clone down this repo and create your own github repository
- update [this](https://gist.github.com/icorson3/fde332a15da213b4c7c3ab319f28b47f) gist by either commenting on it with your repo link or editing the gist.

### Snack Class

```ruby
class Snack
  attr_reader :name, :quantity
  def initialize(name, quantity)
    @name = name
    @quantity = quantity
  end
end
```
- The above Snack class has two attributes: name and quantity.
- Today you will be building out a VendingMachine class.
- The name and how many of that snack are what is being added to the vending machine.
- I have built out tests for the VendingMachine class.
- Your mission is to build out the VendingMachine class on your own.
- I have skipped most of the tests so make sure you are unskipping as you go.
- Please commit to github every 15 minutes.
- At 10am, we will jump into a new group channel (just for the snow day!) and post snippets of responses. I will ask someone specifically to post their solution to each method by looking through repos.
